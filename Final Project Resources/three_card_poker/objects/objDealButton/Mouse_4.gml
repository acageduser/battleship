    //it seems like we're getting an off by 1 error here. Upon starting the game with 1000 dollars,
    //my max bet is 500 for pair plus + ante.
    //If I put 499 in pair plus and 1 dollar in ante, it says my bet is too high
    //but I should be able to bet this amount. When I change pair plus to 498, it lets me play
    
    //update 1: I figured out that the ante isn't being counted (or maybe it's 0? not sure) the
    //first time the player attempts to bet and the bet is too high. So I can bet 501 in pair
    //plus and 500 in ante and it will say my current bet is 501 the first time. I don't change anything
    //and simply click the deal button again, and only then does it say current bet is 1001
    
    //update 2: the ante bet is undefined...
    //To fix this, always read anteBet and pairPlusBet from their input boxes
    //before doing any checks, and donâ€™t rely solely on validBet because its pretty trash and slow
